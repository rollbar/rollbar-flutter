# This file configures the static analysis results for your project (errors,
# warnings, and lints).
#
# This enables the 'recommended' set of lints from `package:lints`.
# This set helps identify many issues that may lead to problems when running
# or consuming Dart code, and enforces writing Dart using a single, idiomatic
# style and format.

# This is a set of lints that used to be in `package:pedantic` but that were
# dropped in `package:lints`, see https://github.com/dart-lang/lints#migrating-from-packagepedantic.
