## Key benefits of using Rollbar for Dart are:
- **Automatic error grouping:** Rollbar aggregates Occurrences caused by the same error into Items that represent application issues. <a href="https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/grouping-occurrences">Learn more about reducing log noise</a>.
- **Advanced search:** Filter items by many different properties. <a href="https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/search-items">Learn more about search</a>.
- **Customizable notifications:** Rollbar supports several messaging and incident management tools where your team can get notified about errors and important events by real-time alerts. <a href="https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/notifications">Learn more about Rollbar notifications</a>.

## Publishing packages

The official packages are published as [`rollbar_dart`](https://pub.dev/packages/rollbar_dart) and [`rollbar_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/rollbar_flutter).

Publishing is straightforward using `pub`, but due to quirks of how ignore files work, the script `build_tools/publish.sh` should always be used to make sure only the necessary files are included, and that the right tool versions are used for publishing.

Eg.:

```sh
./build_tools/publish.sh rollbar_dart
./build_tools/publish.sh rollbar_flutter
```

`rollbar-dart` and `rollbar-flutter` are free software released under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for details.
