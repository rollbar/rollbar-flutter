<p> Attention:</p>

<p>As of April 2024, Rollbar will not be actively updating this repository and plans to archive it. We encourage our community to fork this repo if you wish to continue its development. While Rollbar will no longer be engaging in active development, we remain committed to reviewing and merging pull requests, particularly those about security updates. If an actively maintained fork emerges, please let us know, and we will gladly link to it from our documentation.</p>

This repository contains the `rollbar_dart` package and the `rollbar_flutter` plugin.

For `rollbar-dart`, see its [README](rollbar_dart/README.md).

For `rollbar-flutter`, see its [README](rollbar_flutter/README.md).

## `rollbar-dart` `rollbar-flutter` are currently in Beta. We are looking for beta-testers and feedback

## Key benefits of using Rollbar for Dart are:
- **Automatic error grouping:** Rollbar aggregates Occurrences caused by the same error into Items that represent application issues. <a href="https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/grouping-occurrences">Learn more about reducing log noise</a>.
- **Advanced search:** Filter items by many different properties. <a href="https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/search-items">Learn more about search</a>.
- **Customizable notifications:** Rollbar supports several messaging and incident management tools where your team can get notified about errors and important events by real-time alerts. <a href="https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/notifications">Learn more about Rollbar notifications</a>.


## Documentation

For complete usage instructions and configuration reference, see our [`rollbar-dart` and `rollbar-flutter` SDK docs](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/flutter).

## Release History & Changelog

See our [Releases](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-flutter/releases) page for a list of all releases and changes.

## Vendoring

Since Rollbar will no longer be publishing package updates to pub.dev, it's
recommended that you "vendor" the Rollbar packages into your project so
that you can have full control over package versions, pull in fixes from
the community, etc. For example, the `rollbar_dart` package on pub.dev
currently has an old `http` dependency, even though this has already been
updated on the `main` branch.

To vendor this package in your project, it's recommended to add it as a
`git` submodule. Typically you'll want to fork the repo so that you can
make changes there, and use your fork for the submodule URL, like so:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/rollbar-flutter.git vendor/rollbar-flutter
```

Next, remove `rollbar_flutter: ^X.X.X` from the `dependencies:` block in
your `pubspec.yaml`, and add the following:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...

  # vendored packages
  rollbar_flutter:
    path: vendor/rollbar-flutter/rollbar_flutter
```

## Publishing packages

The official packages are published as [`rollbar_dart`](https://pub.dev/packages/rollbar_dart) and [`rollbar_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/rollbar_flutter).

Publishing is straightforward using `pub`, but due to quirks of how ignore files work, the script `build_tools/publish.sh` should always be used to make sure only the necessary files are included, and that the right tool versions are used for publishing.

Eg.:

```sh
./build_tools/publish.sh rollbar_dart
./build_tools/publish.sh rollbar_flutter
```
