# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

# For lint rules and documentation, see http://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints.
#
# This is a set of lints that used to be in `package:pedantic` but that were
# dropped in `package:flutter_lints`, see https://github.com/dart-lang/lints#migrating-from-packagepedantic.
