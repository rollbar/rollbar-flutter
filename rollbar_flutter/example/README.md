# rollbar_flutter_example

Demonstrates how to use the rollbar_flutter plugin.

This example requires a [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) access token with `post_client_item` scope, which must be set in the [`main.dart`](lib/main.dart) `main` function.

For complete `rollbar-flutter` usage instructions and configuration reference, see our [`rollbar-flutter` SDK docs](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/flutter#flutter).
